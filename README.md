### General Info
***
This project was a group effort that resulted in a full-stack web-application that used external API's like Twillio to create local events and then send invitations to your friends.
## Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15): Version 18.9.1
## Installation
***
To run this application, first a database needs to be set up. This can be done by opening up SQL Server Management Studio and running the queries in the SQLQUERY1.sql file. The code takes care of the rest of the dependancies.
